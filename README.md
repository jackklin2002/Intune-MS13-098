This repository contains a PowerShell script that ensures specific registry paths and values related to certificate validation are correctly configured on both 64-bit and 32-bit systems. The script performs two main functions: checking the existence and correctness of registry paths and values, and creating or setting those values if they are missing or incorrect. The registry paths that are checked and configured are located in HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\Wintrust\Config for 64-bit systems and HKLM:\Software\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Cryptography\Wintrust\Config for 32-bit systems.

The first part of the script checks whether these registry paths exist and verifies that the EnableCertPaddingCheck value is set to "1". If the key or value is missing, incorrect, or not set to the expected value, the script will notify the user and exit with a failure status code. If all checks pass, the script exits with a success status code. The second part of the script ensures that both registry paths and the EnableCertPaddingCheck value are present. If either the registry path or value is missing, the script will create them and set the value to "1".

To use the script, simply run it in PowerShell with administrator privileges, as modifying the registry requires elevated permissions. The script will automatically handle the creation or validation of the required registry settings. If needed, the paths or values in the script can be customized to fit your environment. The script provides output messages to inform you whether the paths and values are correct, and if they are not, it will provide details on what needs to be corrected.

This script requires PowerShell 5.0 or later and administrator privileges to modify the registry. It is intended to ensure that security-related registry settings are correctly configured on Windows systems. The script is useful for system administrators who need to automate the configuration and validation of these settings across multiple systems.
